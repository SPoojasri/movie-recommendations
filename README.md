# Movie Recommendation System

[![Project Flowchart](path/to/flowchart.png)](./path/to/flowchart.png)  ## Project Overview

This project aims to enhance AI-driven personalization for movie recommendations. [cite: 1, 36, 37] The system analyzes behavioral patterns, ratings, and sentiment analysis to provide refined and engaging movie suggestions, thereby improving the user experience. [cite: 2, 37]

## Problem Statement

The core challenge is to improve the accuracy and personalization of movie recommendations using AI. [cite: 1, 36, 37]

## Objectives

* Develop a hybrid recommendation model that combines collaborative filtering and content-based filtering. [cite: 3, 38]
* Increase recommendation accuracy by incorporating user sentiment analysis from reviews. [cite: 4, 39]
* Ensure adaptability through self-learning AI models that dynamically refine suggestions. [cite: 5, 39, 40]
* Compare various machine learning approaches to optimize performance. [cite: 6, 40]

## Project Workflow

1.  **Start**: Initiate the recommendation process. [cite: 6, 40, 41]
2.  **Data Collection**: Gather movie details and user preferences. [cite: 7, 41]
3.  **Data Processing**: Clean and encode relevant data features. [cite: 8, 42]
4.  **EDA & Insights**: Analyze user-movie interactions to identify patterns. [cite: 9, 43]
5.  **Feature Engineering**: Enhance input data to improve recommendations. [cite: 10, 43]
6.  **Model Building**: Implement and evaluate recommendation algorithms. [cite: 11, 44]
7.  **Deployment & Visualization**: Present AI-driven movie suggestions. [cite: 11, 44]
8.  **User Feedback Loop**: Refine recommendations based on user engagement. [cite: 12, 45]

The workflow is also visually represented in the flowchart.

## Data Description

The dataset includes:

* Movie metadata (genres, ratings, cast, director, release year). [cite: 13, 46]
* User preferences (watch history, likes, dislikes). [cite: 13, 47]
* Review sentiments (text analysis for emotional tone). [cite: 14, 48]
* Streaming platform trends (popularity rankings). [cite: 14, 48]

## Data Preprocessing

* Handling missing values (imputation). [cite: 14, 49]
* Encoding categorical features (genres, cast). [cite: 15, 49]
* Processing text for sentiment analysis (tokenization, stop-word removal). [cite: 15, 50]
* Feature scaling & normalization. [cite: 16, 50]

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Genre-watch frequency trends. [cite: 16, 50]
* Correlation mapping of ratings and user engagement. [cite: 17, 51]
* User behavior segmentation through clustering. [cite: 17, 51]
* Sentiment-based polarity scoring. [cite: 17, 51]

## Feature Engineering

* User-movie interaction matrices. [cite: 18, 52]
* TF-IDF feature extraction. [cite: 18, 52]
* Embedding-based similarity measures. [cite: 19, 53]
* Contextual tagging. [cite: 19, 53]

## Model Building

Comparison of approaches:

* Matrix Factorization (SVD). [cite: 20, 54]
* Neural Collaborative Filtering. [cite: 20, 54]
* Hybrid Approach. [cite: 21, 55]
* Graph-based models. [cite: 21, 55]

## Visualization of Results & Model Insights

* Heatmaps for similarity tracking. [cite: 22, 55]
* Feature importance rankings. [cite: 22, 56]
* Precision-recall curves. [cite: 23, 56]
* Confusion matrices. [cite: 23, 56]
